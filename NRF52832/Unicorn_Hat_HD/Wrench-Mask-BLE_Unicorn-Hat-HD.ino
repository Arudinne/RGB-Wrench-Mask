/*  Wrench Mask - BLE Version (NRF52832)
 *  
 *  Hardware Used:
 *  Adafruit Feather NRF52
 *  Pimoroni Unicorn Hat HD x2
 *  
 *  by Brandon C. Allen 
 *  
 *  BLE Functions based on the bleuart example from AdaFruit:
 *  https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/blob/master/libraries/Bluefruit52Lib/examples/Peripheral/bleuart/bleuart.ino
 *  Additional portions of the code are based on the matrixdraw example from gguuss's branch of the AdaFruit NeoPixel library:
 *  https://github.com/gguuss/Adafruit_NeoPixel/blob/master/examples/matrixdraw/matrixdraw.ino
 *  My Library for controlling the Unicorn Hat HD with the Arduino can found here:
