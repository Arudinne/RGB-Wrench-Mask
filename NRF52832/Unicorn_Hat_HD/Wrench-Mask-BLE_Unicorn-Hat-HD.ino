/**
 * RTOS Idle callback is automatically invoked by FreeRTOS
 * when there are no active threads. E.g when loop() calls delay() and
 * there is no bluetooth or hw event. This is the ideal place to handle
 * background data.
 * 
 * NOTE: It is recommended to call waitForEvent() to put MCU into low-power mode
 * at the end of this callback. You could also turn off other Peripherals such as
 * Serial/PWM and turn them back on if wanted
 * 
 * e.g
 * 
 * void rtos_idle_callback(void)
 * {
 *    Serial.stop(); // will lose data when sleeping
 *    waitForEvent();
 *    Serial.begin(115200); 
 * }
 * 
 * NOTE2: If rtos_idle_callback() is not defined at all. Bluefruit will force
 * waitForEvent() to save power. If you don't want MCU to sleep at all, define
 * an rtos_idle_callback() with empty body !
 * 
 * WARNING: This function MUST NOT call any blocking FreeRTOS API 
 * such as delay(), xSemaphoreTake() etc ... for more information
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00016.html
